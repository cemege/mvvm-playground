# MVVM Playground

This repository contains iOS projects used for live coding studies, demonstrating the implementation and evolution of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern in iOS development.

## Projects

### TaskManager

A simple task management iOS application that showcases MVVM architecture implementation.

#### Initial Version
- **Location**: `TaskManager/Initial/TaskManager/`
- **Description**: The starting point of the live coding session
- **Features**: Basic task management functionality with initial project structure

#### Final Version  
- **Location**: `TaskManager/Final/TaskManager/`
- **Description**: The improved version after applying MVVM patterns and enhancements
- **Features**: 
  - Enhanced MVVM architecture implementation
  - Custom view controller with XIB file
  - Extensions for better code organization
  - Improved separation of concerns

## Architecture

This playground demonstrates:
- **Model**: `TaskItem.swift` - Data models and business logic
- **View**: View controllers and XIB files for UI presentation
- **ViewModel**: `TaskViewModel.swift` - Business logic and data binding layer

## Key Learning Points

- MVVM pattern implementation in iOS
- Separation of concerns between View and Business Logic
- Data binding patterns
- Custom view controller creation
- Code organization with extensions

## Requirements

- Xcode 12.0 or later
- iOS 14.0 or later
- Swift 5.0 or later

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open either project in Xcode:
   - For the initial state: `TaskManager/Initial/TaskManager/TaskManager.xcodeproj`
   - For the final state: `TaskManager/Final/TaskManager/TaskManager.xcodeproj`
3. Build and run the project

## Live Coding Sessions

This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding:
- How to refactor code to follow MVVM principles
- Progressive enhancement of iOS app architecture
- Best practices in iOS development
